          In gaming, slumps are quite frequent however are often defined
          incorrectly with a common misconception being slumps are the same as
          inconsistency or a bad day. In reality, slumps are long time periods,
          typically more than 3 or 4 days, when a player is playing worse than
          their average skill level, and have a win rate lower than 50%. Without
          exaggeration, slumps are the biggest reason why any previously
          hypercompetitive player will quit because this can be extremely
          demoralizing as a player often feels no matter what they do, they can
          not win. Especially when a lot of higher level competitive players
          assign the rank in game towards their self value out of game, it is
          obvious how slumps can and will often lead to deterioration of mental
          health, which for a video game is not worth it.

          Slumps occur when players play continuously over months of time
          without actively processing their actions by playing on mostly
          autopilot. An analogy best describing this phenomena is that when one
          drives their car from work and back every single day, on the first few
          days, everyone will be attentive to the roads on where they are going
          thereby less prone to accidents and will drive “better”. However, when
          they drive this route every single day, overtime they will pay less
          and less attention operating into autopilot, where this autopilot mode
          leads to less engagement into driving and “worse” overall driving.
          Similar to gaming, when players play games months on end with little
          to nothing changed in game, they will default to autopilot as a way of
          the brain saving resources. Autopilot leads to slumps because every
          game is highly dynamic and requires micro adjustments to excel. The
          autopilot prevents the player from making these quick reactions.

          To fix this, it is important to find a stimulus to break this repeated
          auto-pilot cycle , in which when the player is able to be stimulated
          they are able to regain more control over their game. This stimulus
          can come in many forms which the most effective ways are to simply
          take a break. After a break, the player is able to come back refreshed
          because the brain now has to actively think about the movements the
          player is executing now which will prevent it from auto-piloting.
          Another way is by saying out loud every decision made in game, which
          serves a similar effect of reading essays out loud. In fact, this is
          often the reason why when players change their settings and / or
          hardware setup they instantly play better, not because the change was
          an objectively better one but simply because the difference in playing
          experiences stimulates the brain which allows the players to play more
          proactively.

        <h3>TL:DR</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Slumps are when a player plays bad for a long period of time</li>
          <li>
            occurs due to their inability to stop autopiloting in game, where
            they shut their brain off and are not as proactive
          </li>
          <li>
            Stimulation out of auto pilot occurs in forms like taking breaks or
            actively speaking out play by play decisions
