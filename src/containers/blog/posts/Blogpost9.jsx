  <p>As a coach once explained to me, tilt is the breaker of potential. This means that many players have the potential to be extremely good in the game but because of their inability to control their anger, they are not able to make it far.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Getting mad at a video game, although unhealthy, is quite common in eSports, especially if you feel as though it is completely out of your control. However, unbeknownst to most, this anger is detrimental to the overall improvement of your skill level. Although it seems like that anger will not affect your play, it will certainly result in yourself playing far more aggressively than you would normally simply because you are upset. However the biggest drawback is not even the misplay of being too aggressive, it is the fact that your brain completely ignores anything related to improving yourself as a player. Whenever any player is mad, they start targeting things that are unrelated to their own play, and even when they make a mistake, they are so upset that it is highly unlikely they notice it, quickly blaming it on their team or the game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because of this, improvement becomes impossible if you tilt often. Hypothetically speaking, you only get tilted once every four games, which doesn&rsquo;t sound terrible, but because often the tilt doesn&rsquo;t go away until the next play session, it is not unlikely half or the entire play session is wasted which is similar to going back in practice time by that entire session. With these statistics it is clear to see the detriment, as it is not uncommon to see players lose up to 50% of their rate in improvement due to their nature to tilt a lot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A way to tackle this problem is to start finding reasons why you tilt. For many this is because things outside of their control happen, a teammate starts throwing, the enemy is toxic, the game bugs etc. However annoying this might be, it is because there is a certain expectation in your team or the enemy team that a game will be in accordance with what you have in mind. The reality is that the actions of your team and the enemy team are completely out of your own control, understanding that and realizing, it is something out of your control and in the longer run these probabilities will balance out should alleviate some of this anger.</p>
<p>Another situation is when you yourself are playing badly, in this case, it is the realization that you are playing terribly and you are frustrated at yourself. In this case, it is important to acknowledge that it is impossible to be always playing at 100% performance and it is completely normal for there to be dips in performance. One should remember improving is a long term process and the individual games should not matter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In general, it is also completely fine to take a break, especially if that benefits your mental health, in which the break can act like a reset. This break can last anywhere between 15 mins to 1 week, which will allow the player to reset their mental state. Although time off might feel like time not improving, it is always 100% better to play in a calm state than an angry one as the efficiency of improvement will rise exponentially.</p>
