        <p>
          Inconsistency is a problem faced by a plethora of players and is the
          most or one of the most complained about problems within any genre of
          competitive video games. This is especially understandably frustrating
          because one day, one will feel as though they are unstoppable and
          improving at a rapid rate just to discover the next day they are
          playing terribly. Contrastingly, good professional players like Faker
          are often seen to be always performing consistently a bar above the
          rest no matter the day of play. To understand inconsistency, this can
          be broken down into 3 categories ranked from most to least popular:
          mechanical, playstyle and external.
        </p>
        <h3>Mechanical</h3>
        <p>
          Mechanical inconsistency is by far the most popular form of
          inconsistency, where mechanics can be defined as any action requiring
          precision and accuracy which can be physical aim or timing of
          abilities, like flash timings in league. In most cases, especially
          when the player is relatively new, the cause of this inconsistency is
          simply due to a lack of training where the player has not practiced
          this mechanic enough for the muscle memory to develop. In this case,
          simply playing the game can be enough, however it is often favored to
          practice in an environment where one is able to repeat such mechanics
          a lot of times to have focused repetition to specifically develop a
          certain mechanic. This can be done in multiple ways mostly depending
          on the options in the game. For most FPS games, a deathmatch FFA mode
          is available where one can practice their aim but more importantly
          adjust their aim to realistic movements by other players. In MOBA
          games like league, for mechanics like CSing, the practice tool is
          great for drilling in things like last hitting or combos.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          As for more experienced players, when the mechanical base is already
          built, the next biggest reason is a lack of warmup. For players to
          play mechanically well, it is required to “wake” the muscles in which
          only when one has a feeling for the game again, they are able to have
          their muscle memory activated. This stresses the importance of warming
          up, however it is important not to go overboard in which 30 mins of
          warmup is known to be, on average, a sufficient amount of time.
        </p>
        <h3>Playstyle</h3>
        <p>
          This is the next biggest inconsistency factor simply due to flaws in
          one’s play. An example to explain this will be for example: in CSGO,
          player A is highly mechanically skilled but is lacking in game sense.
          When playing opponent B who likes to take long range aim duels, player
          A will always win and will feel like they are playing a lot better.
          Constratingly, if there is opponent C who is a more intelligent player
          and is able to pressure from more angles, player A will struggle
          because he lacks gamesense to expect plays that opponent C will pull.
          This is how a lot of inconsistency occurs, where how well a player
          will play depends on how much the enemy will capitalize on the
          player's mistake. Pro players on the other hand will not struggle as
          much with this aspect (although they still do) because at that level,
          most of their large weaknesses have already been corrected so the
          degree of inconsistency will not change as much.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          To help this problem, it is important one watch back through past
          games to determine their biggest weaknesses holding the player back
          and try to correct those problems.
        </p>
        <h3>External</h3>
        <p>
          Lastly, a player must keep in mind their external life like everything
          from school, mental health, diet, relationships etc. which all of
          these have an impact into consistency. This is because overall if a
          player's well-being is bad, this has and will negatively affect a
          players consistency because it doesn't allow the player to give it
          their 100% in game. Obviously it is important to moderate these out of
          game factors to improve in game skill, however often it is even more
          important to take a break from the game and fix external well-being
          factors for a mental reset so there can be a healthy environment for
          skill development.
        </p>
        <h3>TL:DR</h3>
        <p>Inconsistency to a certain extent is unavoidable however can be separated into 3 categories: mechanical, playstyle, external</p>
        <p>Mechanical:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Practice more by training the specific mechanic in deathmatch or practice tool that is deemed inconsistent </li>
          <li>Warmup for 30ish minutes</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Playstyle:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Inconsistency from ability enemy capable capitalizing on mistake</li>
          <li>Find consistent mistakes through vod review, try to minimize</li>
        </ul>
        <p>External:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Keep in check out of game factors, this can affect in game performance a lot more than players believe  </li>
          <li>Important to take breaks</li>
        </ul>
