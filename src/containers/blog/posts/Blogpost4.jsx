          When approaching improvement, placing yourself in an environment where
          you are equipped to improve at the fastest rate is extremely
          important. This environment is primarily dictated by the goals you as
          an individual will set before every play session, where having a clear
          objective will allow you to improve at a much smoother pace. In pro
          play, this aspect is extremely vital as a big responsibility of the
          coach is to set proper goals, which will be discussed on how to. In
          every pro team, before a scrim, the goal of the scrim is heavily
          emphasized to the players. The best places to find these goals to work
          on will be through watching a VOD.

        <h3>Impactful</h3>
        <p>
          By far the most common problem most people encounter after a watching
          VOD, is that they will pick out insignificant goals in terms of
          overall progression of skill. This means that even if the goal is
          fixed, it will not have a huge impact on overall skill. In general,
          the more fundamental to the game a skill is, the more impactful it
          will be and at <u>every</u> single rank, it is important to focus on the fundamentals. This makes
          learning things like combos, or random niche things about certain
          characters not the most effective use of time. Even at the
           professional level, teams miss these basics (for proof, you can watch{" "}

          </a>{" "} 
          an OverwatchLeague coach breakdown the basics in OWL teams). A
          specific type of example of this is having goals on what to do against
          specific enemies or having goals on specific maps, (ex: pop flash line
          ups in csgo). When playing across multiple games, if this goal can
          only be acted upon in a fraction of games, this leaves the rest of the
          games played as wasted. Although learning things mentioned above can
          help, there are things that you can work on which will help
          exponentially more. For most games, on a larger scale, macro is mostly
          simplified to positioning or timing, so finding a goal that tackles
          one of the 2 problems will be most likely impactful.
        </p>
        <h3>Actionability&nbsp;</h3>
        <p>
          Another common reason for bad goal setting is that they will evaluate
          the reason why they lost is because something where they can not
          improve through actionable change. What I mean by this is through
          things like, wanting to increase stats like CS, kills, APM, etc.
          Although it is probably true that if you did increase these stats, you
          would have won, there is such a lack of actionability, the goal is
          relatively useless. For example, for the number of kills, there are 1
          million different factors going into a simple stat like that. As an
          exercise, you can try to think what to do in game to &ldquo;get more
          kills&rdquo; as a goal. This is similar to blaming lost games to
          mechanics which happens rather frequently to players across all games.
          How many times have you said &ldquo;only if I hit that shot I
          would&rsquo;ve won that game&rdquo;. Because mechanics is a muscle
          memory skill, &ldquo;focusing&rdquo; on it, tends to not deliver
          better mechanics and often can even make it worse. When setting goals,
          look for something you can actively and easily change in game.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h3>Quality over quantity</h3>
        <p>
          Lastly, players tend to set goal lists that are way too long, it is
          uncommon to see goal lists of 10+ entries. The problem is that humans
          can only focus on a limited amount of things, of which the optimal
          number for the amount of goals is 1-3. Past that amount, if you try to
          focus on all those goals, the brain is not able to process all of
          these things at once in which it will focus on none, leading the goals
          set to be useless.
        </p>
        <h3>TL:DR</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Goals are best way to setup a direction for improving</li>
          <li>
            Create goals that focus on the fundamentals of the game, no matter
            the rank
          </li>
          <li>
            Goals must be able to be acted on, instead of arbitrary things like
            ex: increasing kills
          </li>
          <li>
            Have 1-3 goals at most to avoid overwhelming with things to work on
          </li>
        </ul>
