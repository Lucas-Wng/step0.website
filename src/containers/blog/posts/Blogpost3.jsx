          Outside of simply playing the video game, the most influential factor
          to improving externally is to VOD review. This is after a game when a
          player goes back to watch the game they played back. The reason why
          VOD reviews are vital to the improvement of a player is because in
          game, so much stimulation is occurring that it is impossible for the
          player to analyze the flaws in their gameplay. Sometimes, which many
          can relate to, players even get overwhelmed by just what is happening
          in the game so analysis of their own gameplay is impossible mid match.
          This is why watching the VOD is so important as they are able to take
          an objective look at the game again. If you have done this before, you
          will know that once you watch back a game you will spot an insane
          amount of instances where you have made big mistakes. This is also the
          reason watching players at the same rank as you in a youtube video
          often look worse than you in game.&nbsp;

        <h3>When to VOD review</h3>
        <p>
          Optimally, the best time to VOD review is right before a play session.
          This is because&nbsp;
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>The clarity of mind</li>
          <li>Can put into practical use, information gained from review</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          The most important aspect when watching back a VOD is having
          objectivity on their own gameplay. Without this, they will not be able
          to pick out their own mistakes and prevent them from climbing. If you
          watch back your games after you play, everything that happened in game
          is still fresh in your mind, example being: how your team didn&rsquo;t
          peel you, toxicity, etc. so when you watch back the game, whatever you
          watch, your ideas will be clouded by the things that happened in game
          which don&rsquo;t matter. Watching back a game from the previous day,
          most likely all those things will be forgotten and you will have an
          easier time picking up on small details that you would have missed.
          Watching the VODs before a play session also provides the benefit of
          being able to apply the findings from the VOD in game to actually
          improve as those mistakes are still fresh in your mind.

        <h3>How to VOD review</h3>
        <p>
          Most people are lost when it comes to this as it is not often clear
          how the regular player should approach this. On Youtube, when watching
          coaches or pro players VOD review randoms, it feels as though this can
          only be done if you have the extensive knowledge of the game that the
          coaches and pro players. For the average player who doesn&rsquo;t have
          this knowledge, VOD reviewing should be more of a discovery process in
          which this is your approach:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Categorize won or loss fights</li>
          <li>
            Determine some of the actions you as a player have done in these
            fights ex: flanking, engaging with the tank, etc
          </li>
          <li>See if there is a connection to winning or losing</li>
          <li>Analyze if this found trend logically make sense</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          By following these steps, the average player is able to start to
          recognize things that happen in which they develop into patterns. The
          patterns that are learnt are often applicable rules that the player
          can now follow in their next games in order to win more teamfights /
          avoid more lost teamfights. With this new found knowledge, the player
          should approach their play session with this as their goal for the
          session.
        </p>
        <h3>TL:DR</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            VOD review before a play session for the reasons mentioned above
          </li>
          <li>
            VOD review by watching multiple teamfights / games to compile
            actions done that affect the outcome of the fight and recognize
            patterns in this
          </li>
          <li>Apply these patterns in game&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
