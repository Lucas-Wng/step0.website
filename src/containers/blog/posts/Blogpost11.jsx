<p>There is a common debate on the importance of voice chat, where some claim it hinders the overall progression while others say it is absolutely crucial to the improvement of any player. The primary function of voice chat is to communicate ideas with your team but the importance of this can be deduced based on the pros and cons.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Able to communicate ideas</li>
<li>Increase coordination</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can and will cause distraction&nbsp;</li>
<li>Often teammates don&rsquo;t use information provided</li>
<li>Toxicity through voice chat can tilt many players</li>
</ul>
<p>In the higher ranks of gaming, especially in pro play, communication and coordination is especially important to the outcome of a game whether it is a win or a loss. However the lower rank one plays at the less impact coordination has on the outcome. To clarify, in most games, the definition / cutoff for lower ranks is plat and below or anything under the 10th percentile of the playerbase. This is because primarily, at lower ranks the biggest reason for a loss is due to fundamental misunderstandings and misplays in the game. Because of this, even if there are improvements in coordination, the players will still have a huge flaw preventing them from winning the game. Another reason is that because the players in the lower ranks have a relatively lack of skill, they are unable to focus on additional input (like communication) as they are already struggling with the fundamental in-game aspects, so they would be unable to use the communication provided to you. So in general, the usage of voice chat is non conducive to the improvement of the player.</p>
<p>However, once a player climbs to the higher ranks, there is a certain familiarity and understanding of the basics in which to win in those higher ranks, the importance of coordination is increased. Thereby leading to an increased importance in communication. However, there are still pros and cons a player must balance out in order to determine if it is useful to the progression of skill.</p>
<p>If one decides to use voice comms, the optimal way to use it would be through telling your team what you are doing. There is a common mistake that many players make, which is telling their team what to do or what not to do. Especially in video games, players will most often just do what they think is best and often, someone else commanding the team is a source of conflict. The best way to tackle this is simply announce what you as a player is going to do so they are simply aware of what's happening. Far too often a lack of communication leads to teammates just simply not being aware of what is happening. An example would be, if a teammate is taking time to flank, the main group should not be pushing in because they should wait for the teammate to get set up. However if this is not communicated, the timing will be off and the fight outcome will be a loss because of that. Because of this, the most optimal way of using voice chat is by telling your team what you are doing so they can accommodate your actions.</p>
<h3>TL:DR</h3>
<ul>
<li>The lower rank you go the less useful voice chat will be</li>
<li>In some situations, voice chat can be detrimental as it is a source of distraction and an opportunity to get mad</li>
<li>Can be useful for coordination</li>
<li>If using voice chat, enable your team by telling them what you are doing</li>
</ul>
