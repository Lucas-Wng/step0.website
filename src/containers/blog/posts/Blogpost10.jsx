    <h1>Space control</h1>
  </div>
  <div className="step0__blog-post-body"><p>In every single game, the importance of space is always underrated. When learning the fundamentals of multiple different game titles, I realized that the game simply boils down to positioning and timing, which the positioning aspect is heavily dependent on the map control. If you do not believe me, here are a few examples of games that have space as a fundamental concept.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overwatch: In most cases, whoever controls the offangles wins as that team is able to put pressure from multiple angles.</p>
<p>CS:GO / Valorant: The whole reason a &ldquo;default&rdquo; exists is to prevent the enemies from taking free space, in which utility or lives are required to take back that given space.</p>
<p>Starcraft: In a macro perspective, whoever controls more resources automatically win, (resources are scattered around the map)</p>
<p>League: The biggest advantage in taking down towers is so players can play around a new section of the map where the enemy team does not have the comfortability to fall back onto a tower.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is clear, throughout every game space is an extremely important concept. The summary of it, whoever controls most space often simply will win the game. This can be applied to your games, in the lower ranks, there is a lot of uncontested territory where you can simply just claim by being there, (this is a large reason why big flanks are so easy to pull off in Valorant at the lower ranks). In the higher ranks, although the spaces are more contested, determine the value of the space you are trying to contest and determine if it is worth taking it back, if not leave it, if it is, devise a plan to do so. The best way to explain this concept is through examples.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Overwatch, you might see a player standing way behind their team, in that case, that space is not valuable as he/she is not able to get much done from standing behind his own team, where all his/her damage is going to be blocked by your team. However, if an enemy is shooting your team from a high ground, (which similar to many games, is an important area to control), take a duel with that enemy with the assistance of your team creating a 2v1. This should force him off and you will be able to gain that space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Valorant, the space of the bombsite is obviously important, so to gain that space, look to use utility to flush out common enemy spots allowing it to be easier for you to take that space.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>TL:DR&nbsp;</h3>
<p>In summary, the idea of map control is something that is extremely crucial to every single video game title and can heavily determine the outcome of any game. Because of this, analyze the area around you and determine the importance of if you should try and contest it or not.&nbsp;</p></div>
