        <p>
          Especially at the higher ranks, it is far too often to see competitive
          players equate their value or worth as a human being in real life, as
          in levels of success / skill. To an outsider this might seem extremely
          childish, however this is extremely rampant within the path to pro
          scene. A way to explain this is, imagine putting quite literally years
          your entire life, with countless 6+ hour days, in practicing towards
          playing better for a higher rank. At this point, the game is not
          simply &ldquo;just a game&rdquo; anymore, this becomes, without
          exaggeration, your life goal.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Especially because the path to pro scene players is so young, (average
          age mostly &lt;18), at this age, most people do not live life enough
          to build other things that demonstrates qualities of themselves,
          (specifically: established careers, other passions, relationships,
          etc.). Consequently, this puts more pressure on excelling at the only
          thing they are doing, which is the game they are improving at.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The problem with this is that when the rank of the player is falling,
          through factors out of their control, this feels as though their
          entire life progress is being undone. Along with their self worth of
          their skill in game, this doubt will also project to other things in
          their life. Commonly, after the players start playing worse they will
          think they are inadequate as a human because they are not even able to
          improve at a &ldquo;silly video game&rdquo;.
        </p>
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>
          Although it is easy to say, &ldquo;just don't think your in-game rank
          has anything to do with you as a person&rdquo;, this is redundant. The
          equation of self worth is done subconsciously because every player
          knows that ultimately their rank won&rsquo;t matter, logically. The
          best way to alleviate this problem is to look for balance in their
          life without trying to give up absolutely everything to improve in
          their game. While most think this means they won&rsquo;t improve as
          fast, this is not necessarily true because setbacks of mentality can
          far outweigh simply time played. When talking about balance, things
          strengthen connections to friends and family, find goals and
          aspirations out of the video game and do the little things that you
          enjoy. This will allow the player to extract the personal attachment
          many have to the game.

        <h3>TL:DR</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            People who spend a lot of time, often hyper competitive players,
            equate their self value to their rank in game, in a way to determine
            how successful they will be in the future
          </li>
          <li>
            This is very unhealthy because any indication of decline in skill
            will heavily negatively impact their mental
          </li>
          <li>
            Improve things out of the game as a way of balancing so your entire
            personality is not the video game
          </li>
        </ul>
