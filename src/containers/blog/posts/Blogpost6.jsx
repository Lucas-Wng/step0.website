        <h1>Addiction vs Dedication vs Intrinsic Motivation</h1>

<p>In gaming, the understanding of these 3 terms are often mixed. This means it is often unclear whether a player is addicted, dedicated or motivated because externally it looks the same in terms of play time. To start out, here are the definitions of each:</p>
<h3>Definitions&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Addiction: &ldquo;physically and mentally dependent on a particular substance, and unable to stop taking it without incurring adverse effects.&rdquo; In most cases, these players often only play the game because of problems that potentially exist externally and use gaming as a way of escaping.</p>
<p>Dedicated: &ldquo;devoted to a task or purpose; having single-minded loyalty or integrity.&rdquo; When one commits to the activity based on their desires to achieve a goal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Intrinsic motivation: &ldquo;stimulate (someone's) interest in or enthusiasm for doing something&rdquo;. Performing an action because the person enjoys the activity done at hand and continues because of the enjoyment.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Analysis</h3>
<p>Out of the 3, addiction is the most harmful and although it might seem like it is a means to playing more hours, this is unhealthy and suboptimal for sustainable improvement. For people struggling with this issue, it is not a bad idea to take a break from gaming all together to sort things in real life out, in order to be able to play and enjoy the game to its fullest potential. Assistance from professional help can be also helpful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The debate between which is better would be more optimal for improvement, dedication vs intrinsic motivation. Although both are beneficial to any player, it is impossible to become extremely good at anything without the usage of both. This is because, for one to do an activity in the long term, if they fundamentally do not enjoy the activity, no matter how much dedication they have, they will stray away from doing it as it is not what they truly want to do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand when improving at anything, there will always be times where the activity is not enjoyable, for reasons like, the person is not improving, the activity is getting repetitive etc. In order to make it through these humps, dedication is important to make it through as often this is where most fail. So by being able to overcome the barrier, one tends to excel a lot after a hump.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>TL:DR</h3>
<p>Although all addiction, dedication and intrinsic motivation can all provide results because of time invested. Addiction is obviously not advisable as it can be unhealthy and have many consequences to it. As for dedication and intrinsic motivation, although intrinsic motivation is crucial for progression in the long term, dedication is important to push through humps without quitting.&nbsp;</p>
