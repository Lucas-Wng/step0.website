    <h1>30-30-40 Rule</h1>
  </div>
  <div className="step0__blog-post-body"><p>In all video game titles, there is a well known rule called the 30-30-40 rule, which is regarded over the time period of at least 2 months. The premise is that 30% of the games are won that are out of your control, 30% of the games are lost which are out of your control and 40%, the deciding factor on win or loss is based on your own gameplay. Based on the nature of the competitive game, these values can be scaled, for example Overwatch, it is more commonly known as the 40-40-20 rule. The logic behind this rule is, because there are so many factors in a game that are out of your control, a lot of the outcomes of the game are also out of your control. These factors can include the skill of your team, toxicity, game bugs, etc. Therefore, the percentages are scaled based on the amount of factors in game. The existence of this rule is proven by, very rarely do you see someone's win rate dip below 30% or go above 70%.</p>
<h3>What to do with this information</h3>
<p>The most common interpretation of this rule is used to explain to players how a lot of the time, even though the player might believe the loss is because of their inability to play well, in reality it is just statistically likely that the outcome was indeterminate based on his/her skill. Using these statistics it's also easy to see how possible loss streaks are. For example, a loss streak of 3 games the probability that it is completely out of your control is 0.3^3 is 2.7%. These changes might seem absurdly low but put into context it makes sense. It is expected that one of these loss streaks will happen 1 every 37 games (1/0.027) and if a player plays 6 games a day (which is the average of most players, depending on the game title), a player can experience these loss streaks on a weekly basis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another way of interpreting is contextualizing your winrate. Often when watching unranked to X rank, the streamer / youtuber seems very impressive being able to win almost every game. Many players will be discouraged if they see win rates at only 55% to 60% which seems relatively low, even if they know they are improving. They wonder if they could do better. However this rule only applies if you are playing in your own rank and in theory, this rule will still apply to the streamers/ youtubers in their own rank. In this case, realizing that you can win at most 60%-70% of the games you play will make players realize they are in reality progressing at a good steady rate.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>TL:DR</h3>
<p>On many occasions, the outcome of the game is out of your control and therefore you should not equate the outcome of a game to the competence of your skill. On top of that, any win rate above 55+% is good progress due to the max possible amount being 60%-70%.</p></div>
